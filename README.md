# Instructions to run:

2. Put a newline b/w the title, question, and answer.
3. Put that text file into the same folder as the python 3.11 script.
4. Run `python3.11 movies_for_interview_gen.py <name-of-the-text-file-with-questions-and-answers.txt> <name-of-topic.mp4>`.
5. Enjoy the output with different configurations from command line in the future.
